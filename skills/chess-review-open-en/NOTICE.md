Third-party components keep their own licenses. The noncommercial restriction above applies only to this project's own files, never to these components:

- Stockfish 19, by the Stockfish developers: GPL-3.0. Bundled as five unmodified official desktop distribution archives under `vendor/stockfish/`, each including upstream source, build scripts, AUTHORS and the GPL license text (Copying.txt). The skill starts Stockfish as a separate process and talks to it only over the UCI protocol; it does not link against or modify it. See `vendor/stockfish/README.md` and `manifest.json` for exact origins and checksums. https://stockfishchess.org/download/ · https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish
- python-chess (`chess` on PyPI), by Niklas Fiekas and contributors: GPL-3.0-or-later. Installed separately by the user with pip; not redistributed here. https://python-chess.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#license
- Chess piece SVG artwork by Colin M. L. Burnett, distributed through python-chess under GPL-3.0-or-later and embedded in generated review pages at build time. Preserve the attribution line in generated pages. https://github.com/niklasf/python-chess/blob/master/chess/svg.py
- Playwright, by Microsoft: Apache-2.0. Optional browser-testing dependency, installed separately. https://github.com/microsoft/playwright

The example PGNs use fictional participant names and are teaching sequences, not personal game records. This repository contains no personal review archive or hosting configuration.
